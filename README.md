This website was developed with bootstrap (css and javascript components), assuring a responsive design.

What was implemented:
- Navbar
- Grid
- Breadcrumbs
- Forms
- Accordion
- Cards
- Carousel
- Login and reservation modals
- jQuery scripts to pause/play carousel and show modals
- Preprocessors scss & less (I used both just to understand the differences of each)
- Distribution folder
- Grunt
